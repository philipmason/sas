SAS WEB INFRASTRUCTURE KIT
==========================
If you have SAS Integration Technologies, then make sure you know what this is since it is the most useful thing to come from SAS in the last 10 years (in my opinion). Why? This is what makes it possible to write a SAS program and make it instantly accessible to be run via a web browser. Supports full security protocols. If you have Enterprise Guide you can even use a wizard to write your program, convert to a stored process and generate a web page to let users run it.

Example:

1 - load or create program in enterprise guide
2 - make it a stored process
3 - run it from Enterprise Guide
4 - run it via sotred process web app, via web page
5 - run it from office add-in
6 - run it from Portal (if available)
